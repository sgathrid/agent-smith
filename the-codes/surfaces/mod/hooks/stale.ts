/**
 * The one place the stall threshold is defined.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: two surfaces (the mod pane and the channel) each need to
 * answer "is this running job actually working?", and if they disagree the user
 * gets a band that says a job is fine while the channel tells Claude it is stuck.
 * That contradiction is the exact failure this project exists to eliminate, so the
 * number is stated once.
 *
 * WHY ONE CONSTANT HERE: the mod cannot resolve a bare specifier for a sibling
 * package, and duplicating the literal in two files is how they drift. So: one
 * constant, here, imported by both surfaces.
 *
 * Value: 15 minutes.
 * Reasoning that number is defensible: agy-staff's own default timeout is 60m
 * (every real spec.json in the corpus says `timeout: "60m"`), so 15m of silence
 * is a quarter of the budget gone with nothing to show, while still leaving ample
 * room for a genuinely long single command like `cargo test --workspace` on a
 * cold target directory.
